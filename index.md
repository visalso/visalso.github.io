I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Rice University, working with Prof. Guido Pagano on trapped-ion quantum technologies, with an anticipated graduation in May 2026. My primary research focuses on experimental realizations of open-system dynamics in chemically motivated models with
engineered coherent and dissipative interactions, sitting at the interface of quantum information, AMO physics, and condensed-matter and chemical physics.
